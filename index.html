        <p> I am a poet, writer and then some residing in Michigan. I have a Bachelor's of Art in Communication and Creative Writing, and soon I will be adding a Masters in Library and Information Science. In the past I have worn many hats as a writer and professional. As seen throughout these pages,  I have published poetry, won awards for short stories and speeches, and have even wrote articles for my coffee blog and previous employers.
